      <description>&amp;ldquo;Why write a blog as a PhD student?&amp;rdquo;, you may ask. Do PhD student not have enough on their plate with study and research alone? Who reads these obscure blogs, anyways? It seems futile.
I think these are legitimite concerns and yet I am starting a blog. So let me address these questions in my first posting, if anything to set some goals for my attempt at blogging.
It is true, my day is full enough.</description>

      <description>My name is Simon Schulten and I am a first-year PhD student at DICE where I study economics and hope to work on topics related to market design and behavioural economics. I also hope to produce some blog posts on topics of interest to me (and hopefully you!).</description>
