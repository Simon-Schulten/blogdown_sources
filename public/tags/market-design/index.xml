      <description>Recently I learnt that a regulation I would have welcomed as an undergraduate at the University of Mannheim actually exists at the University of Cologne. In Cologne, coursework that is completed during a semester abroad can be counted toward the degree albeit on a pass-fail basis rather than graded. This, presumably, levels the playing field between different partner (or even non-partner) institutions with regard to academic rigor and grading cultures. I would have welcomed such a rule as an undergraduate as I had a hard time reconciling these vast differences.</description>
