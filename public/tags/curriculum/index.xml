      <description>Recently, there has been a lot of chatter on #EconTwitter about statistical programming software. Stata users defended themselves for not switching to more powerful technology, while R users were pointing out all the benefits of their beloved programming language.
Basically, every point worth making has been made (though not by everyone). However, I feel there is a lot of misunderstanding between the two sides. As John Horton pointed out in a brilliant subtweet, people seem to assume their use of technology is best, and all other are wrong.</description>
