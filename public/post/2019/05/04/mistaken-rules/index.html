<p>Recently I learnt that a regulation I would have welcomed as an undergraduate at the University of Mannheim actually exists at the University of Cologne. In Cologne coursework that is completed during a semester abroad can be counted toward the degree albeit on a pass-fail basis rather than graded. This, presumably, levels the playing field between different partner (or even non-partner) institutions with regard to academic rigor and grading cultures. I would have welcomed such a rule as an undergraduate as I had a hard time reconciling these vast differences. For example, during my time in the Fachschaft VWL we dealt with several cases where students obtained the highest achievable grade at a partner university in Turkey. The Turkish university would award an A as the highest grad in small courses (say less than 15 students). However, in larger courses an A+ would be awarded to the top student in the course. Needless to say, it is quite frustrating to achieve the highest grade only to get it converted to a 1.3 instead of a 1.0 back in Mannheim, because the course could have been larger in theory. The frustration grew the observation that some students who were struggling in Mannheim went to US partner institutions and achieved a full semester worth of credits with an average grade of 1.0. Needless to say, the &ldquo;Cologne Rule&rdquo; would have resolved the injustice.<br />
There is another rule at the University of Cologne that one may argue is useful as well (though it seems less important to me). The examination regulations subdivide electives into several categories. Students choose a category and complete several courses in that category. The category grade is then the (credit point weighted) average of these courses. The rationale being that students acquire a greater depth in a few topics rather than breadth. So far so straigtforward. Consider, however, the following example. Suppose a student takes an elective course in the microeconomics category and that this category requires, say, four courses to be completed. Further, the student achieves the highest grade, 1.0, in this course. When abroad, the student takes three more courses that qualify for the microeconomics category. As the semester abroad can sometimes be more of a cultural than an academic experience the student barely puts the effort in, but manages to pass all three courses. Back in Germany, this leads to the following unsatisfactory situation: Only one out of four courses is graded 1.0, while the other grades are 4.0. As 4.0 is a pass under the &ldquo;Cologne Rule&rdquo; the category requirement of four courses is fulfilled and the average grade of the category is determined to be 1.0 - as pass-fail grades can&rsquo;t be taken into account when taking averages.</p>

<p>Here we have two seemingly unrelated and seperately justifiable rules that interact to produce an undesired result. The example goes to show that such regulations need to be carefully planned and edge cases need to be examined. I do believe that there are many situations around us that exhibit a similar structure: two or more rules are reasonable on their own, but their interaction creates something weired, even possibly harmful. Let me conclude this post by mentioning three further examples to hopefully drive home this point.<br />
First, consider the quorum rule in a referendum: Each voter can vote yes or no on the question and the majority of votes wins, but the outcome is only valid if x% of the voting age population participated. The interesting edge case is this: Suppose you cast the vote that meets the quorum and all previous votes (the overwhelming majority) are in favour. You are in opposition to the proposition and as a good citizen you see it as your duty to participate in the democratic process. Once you cast your vote the quorum is met and the propositon is accepted, which you could have prevented by abstaining from voting (see <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y4bxbqef">Grüner, Tröger 2018 </a>).</p>

<p>The second example is due to my colleagues at DICE and it is called private damage claims in cartels. Cartels, of course, reduce welfare by reducing competition through price fixing. This harms consumers since they have to pay higher prices, thus it seems a resonably good idea to grant those who are harmed by the cartel the right to reclaim their damages before the courts. However, this contradicts the principle that key witnesses in cartel cases forgo punishment (to get them to testify in the first place).<br />
My last example is from the realm of public economics. It is a widely held position in Germany and elsewhere that taxation should be progressive, that is those who have more should contribute more. Consequently, the German income tax system does just that: the marginal tax rate is increasing in earned income. Another widely held believe is that if you can not earn a living by yourself you are covered by unemployment insurance. However, if you do start to earn some money that transfer is phased out as you earn more. This is true for many different benefits in the German system. However, Andreas Peichl and co-authors show that the bottom line after summing up the different benefit withdrawal rates and taxes, the tax system is not progressive anymore. In fact, there are several edge cases where earning an additional Euro before taxes means your bottom line after taxes is less than if you had not put in the effort to earn that additional Euro. For more info see <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y2kkjb36">Peich et al 2017</a>. Andreas and his co-authors even put in the extra effort and gives policy recommendations to fix this malaise!</p>
