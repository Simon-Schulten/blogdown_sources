<p>&ldquo;Why should a PhD student write a blog?&rdquo;, you might ask. Do PhD students not have enough on their plate with study and research alone? Who reads these obscure blogs, anyways? It seems futile.<br />
I think these are legitimite concerns and yet I have just started a blog. So let me address these questions in my first posting, if anything to set some goals for my attempt at blogging.</p>

<p>It is true, my day is full enough. On top of that, I find it hard to believe that a majority of the things I am going to write down here will be of use to a majority of people out there. However, it is not a necessary condition to write the most insightful blog posts that reach a large number of people.</p>

<p>It is far more important that I personally derive some utility from writing this blog. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, reaching a lot of people may yield considerable utility, but for the moment I am focussing on a few other things. Mainly, I want to practice writing and what better way is there than to write about topics that are of interest to me. In my boldest hopes, I record topics in my blog posts that I am currently thinking about. Making notes of thoughts, additionally to discussing them with others, say, over lunch, creates two positive aspects for me. First, it forces me to organise my thoughts and be coherent (my blog is public after all!). And second, it gives me a way to go back and take a look at what I used to be interested in. I think this second aspect may turn out to be quite valuable in the future, when I recount my days as a grad student. To illustrate, just think back to your childhood. Can you remember what you were interested in for a brief 3 month period? I can&rsquo;t becaue I did not like writing things down when I was little. But had I kept a journal back then, it would be much easier to recall today! I guess you can think of this blog as my academic journal where I attempt to record issues that interest me.</p>

<p>Apart from this personal motivation to keep a blog, there is of course still the point of reach. The other day I came across the notion that the internet&rsquo;s far reach brings an audience to the even obscurest undertakings. I think this was <a href="https://twitter.com/frank_rieger">Frank Rieger&rsquo;s</a> argument for finding it impossible to successfully found a new political party. I am not sure this assessment of our democratic process is entirely correct. But hopefully, someone is out there who may actually stumble across my blog and enjoy it, too!</p>
